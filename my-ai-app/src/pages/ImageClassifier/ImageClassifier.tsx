/**

NOTE :
 TensorFlow is a machine learning and deep learning framework developed by Google.
 TensorFlow is used to build and train models like GPT and Gemini,


 Also in our code : we did not train any model 
  The training is not happening because you are using a pre-trained MobileNet model provided by TensorFlow.js.
  This model has already been trained on millions of images and knows how to classify them into thousands of categories.
 
  . When we upload an image, our app is just using this trained model to classify the image (called inference or prediction).
  . Your app does not perform the training process, which requires a lot of data and computational power.
  . Training means showing many examples to a model and adjusting its internal parameters so it learns to recognize patterns.
  . Since training is expensive and complex, people often use pre-trained models like MobileNet and apply them directly to new images for instant classification.



When Do You Train?
  You train or fine-tune a model if:

  . You want a model to learn new categories or data that the pre-trained model doesn't cover.

  . You want to improve accuracy for a specific task or dataset.

  . This requires labeled data and heavy computation, usually done offline or on powerful serversâ€”not in your React frontend app.
